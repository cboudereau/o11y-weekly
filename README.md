# o11y-weekly

Welcome to o11y weekly (observability weekly!).

Here is the latest news / feedbacks about observability.

I wanted to share my experiment since I am using observability tools for more than a decade! I started with graphite in 2013 thank to [Arnaud Porterie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aporterie/?originalSubdomain=nl) (IIRC, he were leaving France to join Docker in the docker engine team).

A friend suggested me to write blog posts about my own experiments, hands-on but also news in the observability.

This week, for the very first post, lets talk about controversal savings dilemma in Observability I was facing.
